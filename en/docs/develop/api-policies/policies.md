# Policies

Policies are units of business logic that a user can apply to slightly change the  `Request`, `Response`, or `Error` flow of an API invocation before reaching the backend or the client. For example, you can modify the response of an API invocation by adding a policy to the Response flow to transform the payload from JSON to  XML and to add a header in the response. 

Choreo includes a default set of policies covering most of the common use cases. You can attach one or more policies to the component implementation easily through the Choreo Console. Furthermore, you can attach multiple policies, swap, and rearrange them conveniently.

In Choreo, once you attach a mediation policy to a proxy, the deployment, internally, is a two-step process.

1. Deployment initiation 
   If the component to which you attached the mediation policy is new, the system creates and commits a new repository with the mediation service code based on the attached policies. This new service is referred to as the interceptor application. 

2. Deploying the API
    Once the deployment initiation is complete, you can provide any configurations required and proceed to deploy. In this step, Choreo builds the generated interceptor application and pushes the Docker image to the Docker registry. Finally, Choreo deploys the interceptor application with the mediation service and the API Proxy.

 Depending on the flow to which the mediation policy is attached, the API invocation will undergo the respective behavioral modification as follows:

 - In the request path, the requests that pass through the gateway reach the relevant component, and Choreo executes any attached policies to the resource's request path before sending it to the backend. 

- In the response path, the response messages from the backend are first received by the interceptor component, and Choreo executes any mediation policies attached to the `Response` flow or the `Error` flow. Then the response is forwarded to the client.

- In the event an error occurrs during the execution of policies or due to an internal error, the `Error` flow is executed and an error response is sent to the client.


## Monitoring and troubleshooting the deployment

You can check logs at certain stages of the deployment in the console that opens on the right of the page. To open this console, click on a build from the **Build and Deployment History** in the **Build Area**.

#### Code Generation

This is the stage where the interceptor application is generated based on the mediation policies. In this stage, if there are any errors, the user can view them in the console. If the error is due to a user error, for example, an error related to the API definition, etc., based on the logs the user can fix the issue and retrigger a build.

#### Build

The build stage builds the interceptor application as a Docker image and deploys it in the respective environment. For logs related to the build, you can refer build logs of both Ballerina and Docker. 

Any errors that occur in this stage are not due to user error. If an error occurs, you need to retry the deployment.
