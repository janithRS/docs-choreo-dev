# Scheduled Trigger

Learn how to use scheduled triggers to execute routine tasks at specified time intervals.

## What is a scheduled trigger?

A scheduled trigger performs a routine action at scheduled time intervals. Following are examples of scenarios where you can schedule tasks:

- Logging a session time-out message for a user at a specific time interval.

Scheduled triggers automate repetitive tasks, which reduces workload and frees up time for more strategic projects. They also ensure timely and efficient execution of critical tasks and reduce the risk of human error, minimizing downtime in fast-paced business environments.

Following are sample scenarios where you can use scheduled triggers:

- Logging a session time-out message for a user at a specific time interval.

- Publishing a summary of GitHub issues (i.e., with details such as the number of GitHub issues in each status) as a message in a group chat window of a team every day at a specific time.

- Periodically checking an application's health.

## Develop a scheduled trigger

Developing a scheduled trigger refers to configuring an action to be executed.

!!! tip
    The development stage does not require you to specify the time interval at which the system needs to execute the action of the scheduled trigger. You need to provide it only when you deploy the Scheduled Task component.

e.g., If you need to schedule a health check log for an application, you may need to configure the following:

- How the Scheduled Task component gets the heartbeat of the application that it is monitoring

- The conditions based on which the Scheduled Task component can determine whether the application is healthy or not

- A log that indicates whether the application is healthy or not to the end-user

You can design a scheduled trigger via the [Choreo VS code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.choreo) that allows developers to design scheduled triggers with ease. This method involves designing the scheduled triggers from scratch by manually specifying the resources, the HTTP verbs, paths, and other required elements. You can do so in the low-code view or the pro-code view.

### Connect existing Ballerina repository

If you have a scheduled trigger written in the [Ballerina Programming Language](https://ballerina.io), or any other language and containerized as a Dockerfile, you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must save it in a GitHub repository and connect that repository to Choreo at component creation time.

### Bring your Dockerfile

If you have an existing scheduled trigger written in any programming language, you can deploy it in Choreo. To do this, you must generate a Docker image for the scheduled trigger and save the Dockerfile in a private GitHub repository. When you connect this GitHub repository to Choreo, you can build the Dockerfile to pull the scheduled trigger implementation from the Docker image.

## Deploy a scheduled trigger

At the deployment stage, Choreo prompts you to specify the time interval at which it should run the scheduled trigger to execute the configured action.

Once you specify the time interval and proceed to deploy, Choreo starts the process of deploying an API to the default development environment as shown below:

![Deploy scheduled trigger](../../assets/img/scheduled-tasks/deploy-scheduled-task.png){.cInlineImage-xsmall}

Choreo runs a professional, enterprise-grade CI/CD process to deploy APIs to its runtime(data plane) clusters. Under the hood, the data plane of Choreo runs on a Kubernetes stack, benefitting from all its features such as auto-scaling, auto-healing, secret management, liveness, readiness checks, etc.

Once you deploy the scheduled trigger to the development environment, the system exposes it through an API Gateway with API security turned on.

When you deploy the scheduled trigger to the development environment, it is active in the developer environment. When you are ready to take the code to production, you can promote the deployment and enable the functionality for your consumers.

Choreo allows you to view the deployment logs through the **Deploy** view. Therefore you can troubleshoot and view the status of the builds and deployment.

## Choreo environments

Choreo provides a development environment and a production environment in two separate Kubernetes clusters by default. Once you have deployed the scheduled trigger to the development environment and verified whether it functions as expected, you can promote it to the production environment.

If required, you can change the time interval of the scheduled trigger before you promote it to the production environment.

## Observe a scheduled trigger

You can assess the performance of your scheduled trigger by observing the success and failure rates of the requests sent to it. The observability view allows you to visualize the performance statistics via interactive graphs.

To learn more about how you can observe your scheduled trigger, see [Observability Overview](../../observe-and-analyze/observe/observability-overview.md).
