# Test an API
 
Before using your API in production, you can test it using the integrated console in Choreo. Once you deploy your API in the required environment, an API consumer can use the application credentials, generate an OAuth 2.0 token, and invoke the API to test its functionality by providing values for the required parameters. 

This guide will take you through the steps to test an API in Choreo. 

1. Sign in to Choreo Developer Portal at [https://devportal.choreo.dev](https://devportal.choreo.dev). Alternatively, click **Go to DevPortal** on the Choreo Console or the Developer Portal icon on the left navigation menu.

2. Click **APIs**.

3. Select an API you want to test and click **Try Out** on the card. In this case, skip step 4. Alternatively, you can click on the API and follow step 4. 
4. In the left pane, click **Try Out**.
5. Select the required environment from the **Environment** list.

6. Select the required endpoint from the **Endpoint** list.

    If you want to test the API in your sandbox environment before invoking it in the development/production environment, select the endpoint with the **Sandbox** label.

    !!! info
        You can provide a sandbox endpoint for testing purposes when you deploy your REST API. For more information, see [Deploy Your Component](../deploy/deploy-your-component.md).
        
    To try out the API in the development/production environment, select the endpoint with the **Development** or **Production** label as relevant.

7. From the **Subscribed Application** list, select the application you used to subscribe to the API. To learn how to subscribe to an application, see [Manage Subscriptions](manage-subscription.md). 

8. Click **Get Test Key** on the **Access Token** field to generate a test access token. To learn more about access tokens and generating tokens for production usage, see [Manage Applications](manage-application.md#generate-keys).

9. Next, expand a resource you want to test by clicking on it.

10. Click **Try it Out** to enable the resource to be tested.  
11. Fill in values for the required parameters and click **Execute**.

12. Once Choreo executes the request, you can view the response in the Choreo Console.
