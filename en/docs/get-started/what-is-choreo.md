# What is Choreo?

Today, with the growth of the global API ecosystem, APIs have become an essential part of modern engineering. Therefore, it has become necessary for organizations to participate in this global API supply chain by consuming and producing APIs. The adoption of cloud and microservices-based distributed architecture has also become increasingly significant, causing more and more organizations to rapidly evolve and look for innovative ways to build their digital business ecosystem. This has led to the need for a state-of-the-art iPaaS that can address the complex challenges that organizations face when connecting applications, systems, and data to build integrations and expose those integrated services to internal and external consumers in a future-proof manner.
