** Create Your First Containerized Service Component

Learn to deploy a containerized Go service component on Choreo without prior knowledge of the language. The tutorial covers fundamental features for deploying containerized apps in any language using Choreo.

## What are we building?

In this tutorial, we are building a simple greeting service. Since we intend to learn how you can deploy the Dockerfile-based application in Choreo, we want to keep our program code as simple as possible. 
Choreo will use the provided Dockerfile to build the deployable greeter service.

Our `greeter` service has a single resource named `greet`. The service accepts a single query param as input and runs on port 9090.

#### Request:

```bash
$ curl GET http://localhost:9090/greeter/greet?name=Choreo
```

#### Response

```bash
$ hello Choreo!
```

Our next step is to set up the resources required to follow the tutorial, including the sample greeter application and the  [Choreo GitHub app](https://github.com/marketplace/choreo-apps)

## Prerequisites

1. To deploy a containerized component, you will need a GitHub account with a repository that contains a Dockerfile. For this tutorial, let's fork and use the [choreo-sample-apps repository](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps).
2. The **Choreo GitHub App** requires the following permissions:
    * Read access to issues and metadata
    * Read and write access to code, pull requests, and repository hooks

!!! info
    For more information, see  [Containerized Application Deployment](../../deploy/containerized-application.md).

Let's get started!

## Repository file structure

Before proceeding with the tutorial, it's important to familiarize yourself with the key files in our sample greeter application. Below is a table with a brief overview of these important files in our greeter service.

!!! note
    The following file paths are relative to the path `<sample-repository-dir>/go/greeter`

| Filepath                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **main.go**                | Greeter service code written in Go language.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Dockerfile**             | Choreo uses the Dockerfile to build the container image of the application.                                                                                                          |
| **.choreo/endpoints.yaml** | Choreo-specific configuration that provides information about how Choreo exposes the service .|
| **openapi.yaml**           | OpenAPI contract of the greeter service. This is needed to publish our service as a managed API. This openapi.yaml file is referenced by the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml`. |

## Create a service component from a Dockerfile

Let's create a containerized service component by following these steps:

1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at [https://console.choreo.dev](https://console.choreo.dev).
2. Create a project to add the service component. You can follow the instructions under [Prerequisites in the Connect Your Own GitHub Repository to Choreo](../../develop/manage-repository/connect-your-own-github-repository-to-choreo.md#prerequisites-create-a-project) tutorial.
3. On the **Components** page, click **Create** on the **Service** card.
4. Enter a unique name and a description of the service. For this tutorial, let's enter the following values:
    
    | **Field**       | **Value**         |
    |-----------------|-------------------|
    | **Name**        | `Greetings`       |
    | **Description** | `Sends greetings` |

    Click <strong>Next</strong>.

5. Click **Authorize with GitHub** to allow Choreo to access your GitHub repository with the forked greeting service code in the prerequisites section above.
    If you have not already authorized Choreo applications, click **Authorize Choreo Apps** when prompted.
    Once you perform the authorization, the **GitHub Account** field in the **Connect Repository** dialog box will display the GitHub account.
6. Select the following values to connect the repository:
    
    | **Field**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Value**                  |
    |-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
    | **GitHub Account**            | Your GitHub account. If you want to add another GitHub account, you can expand the list, click <strong>+ Add</strong>, and repeat step 6.                                                                                                                                                                                         | select your GitHub account |

    !!! info
        To successfully build your container with Choreo, it is essential to explicitly define a User ID (`UID`) under the `USER` instruction in your Dockerfile. For reference, see [sample Dockerfile](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-sample-apps/blob/main/go/greeter/Dockerfile).
    
        ```
         To ensure that the defined USER instruction is valid, it must conform to the following conditions:
        
         - A valid User ID is a numeric value between 10000-20000, such as `10001` or `10500`.
         - Usernames are considered invalid and should not be used. For example, `my-custom-user-12221` or `my-custom-user` are invalid User IDs.
        ```

    !!! info
        The Dockerfile utilized in this tutorial is a  [Multi-stage Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/), which is designed to keep the final image size small and provides the ability to build the application with a specific version of tools and libraries.   
          
7. Click **Create**. Once the component creation is complete, you will see the component overview page.

You have successfully created a **Service** component from a Dockerfile. Now let's build and deploy the service.

## Configure the service port with endpoints

As previously mentioned, our greeter service runs on port 9090. To securely expose the service through Choreo, we must provide this port and other relevant information.
In Choreo, we expose our services with endpoints. You can read more about endpoints in our [Service](../../develop/components/service.md#what-are-endpoints-in-service-components) component documentation.

Choreo looks for an `endpoints.yaml` file inside the .choreo directory to configure the endpoint details of a containerized component. Place the `.choreo` directory at the root of the Docker build context path.

In our greeter sample, the `endpoints.yaml` file is at `go/greeter/.choreo/endpoints.yaml`. Our build context path is `go/greeter`.

## Build and deploy

Now that we have connected the source repository, and configured the endpoint details, it's time to build and deploy the greeter service.

To build and deploy the service, follow these steps:

1. On the **Deploy** page, click **Deploy Manually**

    !!! note
        Deploying the service component may take a while. You can track the progress by observing the logs.
        Once the deployment is complete, the deployment status changes to **Active** in the corresponding environment card.

2. Check the deployment progress by observing the console logs on the right of the page.

    You can access the following scans under **Build**.
    * **The Dockerfile scan**: Choreo performs a scan to check if a non-root user ID is assigned to the Docker container to ensure security. If no non-root user is specified, the build will fail.
    * **Container (Trivy) vulnerability scan**: This detects vulnerabilities in the final docker image. If you click **Container (Trivy) vulnerability scan**, the details of the vulnerabilities open in a separate pane. If this scan detects critical vulnerabilities, the build will fail.

    !!! info
        If you have Choreo environments on a private data plane, you can ignore these vulnerabilities and proceed with the deployment.

Once you have successfully deployed your service, you can test, manage, and observe it like any other component type in Choreo.

For detailed instructions, see the following sections:

* [Step 3: Test](../../test/invoke-apis-via-console.md)
* [Step 4: Manage](../../manage/api-management.md)
