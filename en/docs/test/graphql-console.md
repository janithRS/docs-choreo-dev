# GraphQL Console

!!! note
    Choreo will deprecate the GraphQL component in the future. We recommend using the Service component and [Test Console](../test/invoke-apis-via-console.md#graphql-endpoints) to test your GraphQL APIs.

The GraphQL Console is an interactive UI that guides you to write queries and mutations to test the GraphQL API. Choreo uses OAuth2.0 authentication to secure GraphQL APIs by default. Therefore, the GraphQL Console allows you to generate test keys to test the APIs.

# Test your GraphQL API

!!! note
    If you are on the **Deployment** tab, click **Test** in the **Development** card and continue from step 4 onward.

1. Sign in to the Choreo Console at [https://console.choreo.dev/](https://console.choreo.dev/).

2. From the components list, click the GraphQL component you want to test

3. To open the test view, click the **Test** on the left navigation menu and then click **GraphQL console**.

4. Enter the API path and the query or mutation you want to test and press the **Play Button**.

Congratulations! You have now successfully created and tested a GraphQL in Choreo!
